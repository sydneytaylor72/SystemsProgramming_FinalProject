Contents: README - this file
	  parser.c - implementation of parser
	  shell.c - implementation of shell
	  shell.h - shell header file
	  Makefile - builds the program
Running: To build/compile, use Makefile and run make in command line. To execute, run ./run-tests in
         command line to execute the tests or ./shell to run the shell.
Implementation notes: Rather than implement functions, the entire program is in the main function.
		      Used strcmp to compare a command with a built-in function. If the command does
		      not match a built-in function, it is passed to the external commands redirection
		      section. Used perror() and fprintf() to stderr to print errors. Did not implement
		      any helper functions.	      
Limitations: N/A
References: Based external commands and redirection section off of Lab2.
